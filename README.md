Abstract: Televised presidential debates have been a staple of campaigning and political culture in the United States ever since 1960. While extensive research exists on the effect of debates on the general American electorate, this project specifically focuses on the effects of debates on the undecided voter. Specifically, this research focuses on the effects of issue statements presented in debates, rather than visual components such as poise, demeanor, and appearance. Data was collected from a survey yielding 206 individual responses from a diverse array of backgrounds. A hypothetical election was established, and subjects read a series of ten issue statements made in this hypothetical election. After considering statements, subjects indicate their preference, or lack thereof, for one of the candidates. Though initial analysis led to insignificant results in the interaction between voters without a strong party identification and an undecided vote in this hypothetical election, follow up analyses indicated significant interactions in both race and physical ability in the inability to cast preference for our hypothetical candidates.
